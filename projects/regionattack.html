        <p>
          During my enrollment in CSE403 at the University of Washington, I got involved in making a virtual board game called Region Attack. Using Unity, we were able to successfully develop a functional game that was able to be deployed to Android or iOS.
          I was responsible for the front end development, which involved some coding with C# for Unity, as well as some insight into the CI/CD tool that GitHub has.
